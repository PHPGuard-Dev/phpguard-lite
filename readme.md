# PHPGuard Lite

PHPGuard Lite is the free WordPress plugin that scans PHP code before it runs.

It allows WordPress site owners and developers to:
- Scan plugin ZIP files before installation
- Scan installed plugins
- Scan PHP code snippets
- Detect syntax errors that would otherwise cause fatal errors or white screens
